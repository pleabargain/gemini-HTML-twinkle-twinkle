# Responsive Animated Piano Keyboard

## Description

This is an interactive web application that displays a **5-octave piano keyboard (C2-C7)** which **responds dynamically to the browser window size**. It animates the playing of selected melodies like "Twinkle Twinkle Little Star" and "Mary Had A Little Lamb". The application visually highlights the keys being pressed, shows the name of the current note, and plays the corresponding sound using the Web Audio API. Users can **select different songs**, **adjust the playback speed**, and **view the underlying musical data structure** for the selected piece.

The entire application is built using vanilla HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, requiring no external libraries or frameworks.

## Features

*   **Dynamically Generated Keyboard:** A 5-octave (C2-C7) keyboard is created programmatically using JavaScript.
*   **Responsive Layout:** The piano keyboard adjusts its width to fit the browser window without requiring horizontal scrolling. White keys use CSS Flexbox, and black key positions are dynamically calculated.
*   **Song Selection:** A dropdown menu allows users to choose from available melodies.
*   **Playback Speed Control:** A slider allows adjusting the playback speed from slow (0.25x) to fast (2.5x).
*   **Visual Animation:** Keys are highlighted sequentially as the selected melody plays.
*   **Note Display:** Shows the name of the note currently being played (e.g., "C4", "G4").
*   **Audio Playback:** Plays the notes using the Web Audio API's OscillatorNode, respecting the selected playback speed.
*   **View Music Data:** Displays the raw JSON data for the currently selected song in a formatted view, updating automatically on selection change.
*   **Pure Vanilla JS:** Built entirely with standard HTML, CSS, and JavaScript.

## Demo

To see it in action, simply open the `index.html` file in a modern web browser.

## Technology Stack

*   **HTML:** Structures the piano container, note display, song selection dropdown (`<select>`), speed control slider (`<input type="range">`), play button, and the JSON view area (`<pre>`). Uses `data-note` attributes on keys.
*   **CSS:**
    *   Styles the piano appearance.
    *   Uses **Flexbox** (`display: flex`, `flex: 1`) on white keys for responsive width distribution.
    *   Styles black keys with `position: absolute` and relative/limited dimensions. `left` and `transform` properties are set dynamically via JS.
    *   Manages container layout (`#piano`, `.controls`) and styling for interactive elements.
    *   Uses an `.active` class for the key highlight effect with `transition`.
*   **JavaScript:** Handles all the logic:
    *   **DOM Manipulation:** Dynamically creates key elements, selects UI controls, updates note display, adds/removes CSS classes, updates JSON view text.
    *   **Keyboard Generation & Positioning:**
        *   Loops through octaves and notes to create `div` elements for keys.
        *   Uses `requestAnimationFrame` after initial render to calculate and apply the `style.left` and `style.transform` for black keys based on the computed position and size of the preceding white keys (`getBoundingClientRect`).
        *   Handles window resize events (debounced) to recalculate black key positions.
    *   **Timing & Animation:** Uses `async/await` with a `delay` helper function (which incorporates the `playbackSpeedFactor`) to sequence note highlights and pauses accurately.
    *   **Data Structures:** Represents melodies as arrays of objects (`note`, `duration`). A main `melodies` object maps dropdown values to specific melody arrays. A `keyElementMap` object provides quick lookup of key DOM elements by note name.
    *   **Web Audio API:** Generates and plays sound:
        *   Initializes `AudioContext` on user interaction.
        *   Maps note names to frequencies (`noteFrequencies` object).
        *   Uses `OscillatorNode` and `GainNode`.
        *   **Scales audio note duration** and fade-out times based on the `playbackSpeedFactor`.
    *   **Event Handling:** Listens for clicks (play button), input changes (speed slider), selection changes (song dropdown), and window resize.
    *   **State Management:** Uses variables like `playbackSpeedFactor` and `audioContext`.

## How It Works (Approach)

1.  **HTML Structure:**
    *   A main container (`#piano`) is defined, initially empty.
    *   Control elements (`<select>`, `<input type="range">`, `<button>`) and display areas (`#note-display`, `#music-json-display`) are set up.

2.  **JavaScript Initialization:**
    *   On script load, the `createKeyboard()` function is called.
    *   `createKeyboard()`:
        *   Clears the `#piano` container.
        *   Loops from `START_OCTAVE` to `END_OCTAVE`, creating `div` elements for each note ('C' through 'B').
        *   Assigns `key`, `white`/`black`, and `data-note` classes/attributes.
        *   Appends all created keys to the `#piano` container.
        *   Populates a `keyElementMap` for quick access.
        *   Calls `requestAnimationFrame(positionBlackKeys)` to defer positioning until the initial layout is done.
    *   `positionBlackKeys()`:
        *   Selects all `.black` keys.
        *   For each black key, finds its preceding white key element (using the `keyElementMap`).
        *   Gets the dynamic position and dimensions of the white key using `getBoundingClientRect`.
        *   Calculates the `left` offset relative to the piano container.
        *   Applies the calculated `left` style and uses `transform: translateX(-50%)` to center the black key visually over its target position.
    *   The initial JSON view is populated for the default selected song.
    *   Event listeners are attached (play, speed slider, song select, window resize). The resize listener is debounced and calls `positionBlackKeys`.

3.  **CSS Styling:**
    *   `#piano` uses `display: flex` and `overflow: hidden`.
    *   `.white` keys use `flex: 1 1 auto` allowing them to grow/shrink to fill the container width. `min-width` prevents excessive shrinking.
    *   `.black` keys use `position: absolute`, `z-index: 2`, and have responsive width/height (e.g., percentage-based or max/min pixel values). Their exact horizontal position is determined by the JS-applied `left` style.

4.  **User Interaction:**
    *   **Song Selection:** Changing the dropdown triggers an event listener that calls `updateMusicJsonView()`.
    *   **Speed Adjustment:** Moving the slider updates the `playbackSpeedFactor` variable and the displayed speed value.
    *   **Play Button:**
        *   Initializes/resumes the `AudioContext`.
        *   Reads the selected song key and retrieves the corresponding `melody` array.
        *   Reads the current `playbackSpeedFactor`.
        *   Disables controls.
        *   Calls the `async playSong(melody)` function.
    *   **`playSong()` Execution:**
        *   Iterates through the `melody` array.
        *   For each `noteItem`:
            *   Calls `playNoteSound()`, passing the note and duration. (Inside `playNoteSound`, the actual audio duration is divided by `playbackSpeedFactor`).
            *   Calls `highlightKey()` using the `keyElementMap` for quick lookup.
            *   `await delay(noteItem.duration)`: Pauses execution. (Inside `delay`, the pause time is divided by `playbackSpeedFactor`).
            *   Removes the highlight.
            *   Adds a small scaled gap using `await delay(noteGap)`.
        *   Re-enables controls upon completion.
    *   **`updateMusicJsonView()`:** Retrieves the selected melody data, uses `JSON.stringify(..., null, 2)` for formatting, and updates the `<pre>` tag's content.

## Setup and Usage

1.  Save the HTML code as `index.html`.
2.  Save the CSS code as `style.css` in the same directory.
3.  Save the JavaScript code as `script.js` in the same directory.
4.  Open `index.html` in a modern web browser (like Chrome, Firefox, Edge, Safari).
5.  Select a song from the dropdown.
6.  (Optional) Adjust the playback speed using the slider.
7.  View the structure of the selected song in the "Selected Music Data" area.
8.  Click the "Play Selected Song" button to start the animation and sound.

## Potential Expansions

*   **More Songs:** Add more melody data and corresponding `<option>` tags. Consider loading melodies from external JSON files.
*   **User Piano Interaction:** Allow users to click/tap keys (or use computer keyboard) to play notes visually and audibly.
*   **Improved Sound:** Implement ADSR envelopes (`GainNode` ramps) or load real piano samples (`AudioBufferSourceNode`).
*   **Visual Enhancements:** Add more realistic key styling, pressing animations, or visual feedback for audio context state.
*   **Playback Controls:** Add pause, stop, loop, or progress bar features.
*   **Music Theory:** Display chord names or scale information related to the melody.
*   **Error Handling:** More robust handling for missing frequencies or audio context issues.
*   **Accessibility:** Improve ARIA attributes and keyboard navigation for controls and potentially the piano keys themselves.
