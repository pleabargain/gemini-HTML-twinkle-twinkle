   - Implemented chord detection based on timing thresholds
   - Added functionality to save recordings as JSON files

4. **Stop Button and Playback Control**
   - Added a stop button to halt playback immediately
   - Improved state management during playback and recording
   - Enhanced error handling for audio context initialization

## Next Steps

1. **Load Custom Recordings**
   - Implement functionality to load saved JSON recordings
   - Add a file picker interface for selecting recordings
   - Create a library of user recordings

2. **Improved Sound Generation**
   - Research and implement more realistic piano sounds
   - Add ADSR envelope controls for better sound shaping
   - Explore options for sampled instrument sounds

3. **Visual Metronome**
   - Add a visual metronome to help with timing during recording
   - Implement tempo detection for recordings
   - Add beat markers in the scrolling display

4. **Accessibility Enhancements**
   - Improve keyboard navigation throughout the application
   - Add ARIA attributes for screen reader support
   - Enhance color contrast for better visibility

5. **Mobile Optimization**
   - Improve touch interaction for mobile devices
   - Optimize layout for smaller screens
   - Add responsive design breakpoints for different device sizes

## Active Decisions and Considerations

1. **Chord Detection Algorithm**
   - Currently using a time-based threshold (CHORD_THRESHOLD) to group notes into chords
   - Considering more sophisticated approaches that analyze musical context
   - Evaluating the trade-offs between simplicity and accuracy

2. **Audio Generation Approach**
   - Currently using OscillatorNode with triangle wave for sound generation
   - Considering options for more realistic piano sounds:
     - Web Audio API with custom waveforms
     - Sample-based playback
     - Wavetable synthesis
   - Evaluating performance implications of different approaches

3. **Data Structure for Melodies**
   - Current structure: Array of objects with `note` (string/array/null) and `duration` properties
   - Considering adding metadata for tempo, time signature, etc.
   - Evaluating compatibility with standard MIDI file format for import/export

4. **Browser Compatibility Strategy**
   - Prioritizing Chrome/Edge for full feature support
   - Implementing graceful degradation for browsers without MIDI support
   - Considering polyfills for older browsers

## Important Patterns and Preferences

1. **Code Organization**
   - Group related functions into logical sections with clear comments
   - Use descriptive variable and function names
   - Maintain separation of concerns between UI, audio, and MIDI handling

2. **Error Handling**
   - Implement graceful degradation for unsupported features
   - Provide clear user feedback for error states
   - Use try/catch blocks for potentially problematic operations

3. **Performance Optimization**
   - Minimize DOM operations during playback
   - Use requestAnimationFrame for visual updates
   - Implement debouncing for window resize events
   - Clean up audio nodes to prevent memory leaks

4. **User Interface Design**
   - Maintain a clean, minimalist aesthetic
   - Use consistent color scheme and visual language
   - Provide clear visual feedback for user actions
   - Ensure all interactive elements are obviously clickable
