### Current Sprint Focus
- Refining the chord detection algorithm
- Improving the scrolling note display
- Enhancing visual feedback during playback
- Optimizing performance on different devices

## Known Issues

1. **Audio Timing Precision**
   - **Issue**: Slight timing inconsistencies can occur during playback, especially at faster speeds
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Use moderate playback speeds for most accurate timing
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement more precise timing using scheduled audio events

2. **MIDI Device Reconnection**
   - **Issue**: Sometimes requires page refresh when MIDI devices are disconnected and reconnected
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Refresh the page after reconnecting MIDI devices
   - **Planned Fix**: Improve MIDI device state handling and reconnection logic

3. **Chord Detection Edge Cases**
   - **Issue**: Very fast arpeggios may be incorrectly detected as chords
   - **Severity**: Low
   - **Workaround**: Play arpeggios with more distinct timing
   - **Planned Fix**: Refine chord detection algorithm with musical context awareness

4. **Browser Compatibility**
   - **Issue**: Limited functionality in browsers without Web MIDI support (Firefox, Safari)
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Use Chrome or Edge for full functionality
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement feature detection and graceful degradation

5. **Mobile Experience**
   - **Issue**: Interface not fully optimized for small screens
   - **Severity**: Medium
   - **Workaround**: Use in landscape orientation on larger mobile devices
   - **Planned Fix**: Implement responsive design breakpoints for mobile

## Evolution of Project Decisions

   - **Evolution**: Tabbed interface separating piano and data views
   - **Rationale**: Better organization and focus on primary functionality

5. **Note Display**
   - **Initial Approach**: Simple text display of current note
   - **Evolution**: Scrolling display with note/chord visualization
   - **Rationale**: Enhanced visual feedback and educational value

### Pivotal Decisions

1. **Vanilla JavaScript Approach**
   - **Decision**: Use only native web technologies without frameworks
   - **Impact**: Simplified development process, reduced dependencies
   - **Result**: Lightweight application with good performance

2. **Client-Side Only Architecture**

   - **Impact**: Works offline, no deployment complexity
   - **Result**: Portable application that can run from local files

3. **JSON Data Structure**
   - **Decision**: Use a simple, flexible format for melody representation
   - **Impact**: Easy to understand and manipulate
   - **Result**: Straightforward recording and playback implementation

4. **Dynamic DOM Generation**
   - **Decision**: Generate UI elements programmatically rather than static HTML
   - **Impact**: More flexible, responsive layout
   - **Result**: Adaptable interface that works across different screen sizes

### Lessons Applied

1. **Performance Optimization**
   - **Lesson**: DOM operations during audio playback can cause timing issues
   - **Application**: Separated visual updates from audio processing
   - **Result**: More consistent playback timing

2. **Error Handling**
   - **Lesson**: Browser APIs can fail in unexpected ways
   - **Application**: Implemented comprehensive error handling and fallbacks
   - **Result**: More robust application with better user feedback

3. **User Experience**
   - **Lesson**: Visual feedback is crucial for musical applications
   - **Application**: Added multiple forms of visual feedback (keyboard, scroller, indicators)
   - **Result**: More intuitive and engaging user experience

4. **Code Organization**
   - **Lesson**: Audio and MIDI code can become complex quickly
   - **Application**: Organized code into logical modules with clear responsibilities
   - **Result**: More maintainable codebase with better separation of concerns
